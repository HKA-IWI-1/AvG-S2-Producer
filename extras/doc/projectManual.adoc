== The Server Producer

=== The server at a glance

This server was created as part of a group work in our course AvG (Automatisierung von Geschaeftsprozessen, Automation of business processes).


=== The Jakarta Messaging API

The server also receives buy/sell orders from a message broker app and sends stock update messages to the same broker.

=== The Business Logic

The status of the received orders get updated, serialized and sent back to the message broker. The updated stock data get periodically sent to the message broker, too.
